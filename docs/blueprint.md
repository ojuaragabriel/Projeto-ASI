# **App Name**: AcademicFlow

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure login for coordinators, PROGRAD, department heads, and professors.
- Coordinator Dashboard: Dashboard for coordinators to manage semester summaries, demands, and professor allocations.
- PROGRAD Approval Workflow: Interface for PROGRAD to approve or reject course demands.
- Department Allocation: Allocation interface for department heads to assign professors to courses, considering preferences and workload.
- Preference Submission: Professors can submit their course preferences with optional justifications.

A tool enables a coordinator to resolve them by manually selecting the professor with justifications.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: UESC Blue (#0071BC) to maintain the institutional feel. This translates to HSL (207, 100%, 37%)
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7) to provide a clean, professional backdrop.  This translates to HSL(210, 20%, 95%)
- Accent color: A vibrant sky blue (#72BCD4) for interactive elements and highlights, to complement the institutional blue. This translates to HSL(194, 38%, 64%)
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern, neutral, and readable style.
- Minimalist line icons for actions (edit, conflict, approve, reject) to ensure clarity and a modern aesthetic.
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop, with a clear dashboard design featuring fixed side menus and card-based status indicators.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on interactions (e.g., loading, form submission).
